ðŸŽ¶ Opinionated, barebones music manager.

## About
*seiri* is a music manager designed for large libraries (10000+ tracks). The manager was created to be *opinionated*. It organizes music in one way and has few customizable options. *seiri*'s features are constrained to keep large libraries of music consolidated and searchable. *seiri* depends on how files are organized in folders, and ignores music players and song tagging tools. *seiri* works best with music players that disregard where music is stored, such as [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/).

## *seiri* features.
* Move files between directories.
* Makes music queryable.
* Keeps large libraries organized.
* Fast performance.

## What *seiri* does not do.

*seiri* does not perform any of the following functions: 

* [Play music.](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
* [Transcode music.](https://www.freac.org/)
* [Suggest music.](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
* [Identify music](https://www.shazam.com/)
* [Edit tags.](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)
* [Lookup CDs.](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/)
* [Rip CDs](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/).
* [Split CUE rips.](http://cue.tools/wiki/Main_Page)
* [Download music.](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/genre/music/id34)
* [Sync to your device.](https://getmusicbee.com/)
* [Upload music to a locker](https://play.google.com/music/)

## Rules

For *seiri* to work best, you should accept its 6 easy rules.

1. Single-file CUE rips are **forbidden**
2. Your entire music library should be under one folder.
3. Tracks are sorted in an artist folder first, then album.
4. All music **must be properly tagged**. *seiri* won't accept "mymixtape.mp3" with no artist or album. This also means that WAV audio is **forbidden**. Use FLAC (or AIFF if you really need that 32bit float).
5. Let *seiri* handle sorting for you. Do not move tracks around in the library folder. 
6. Cover art in the tags. **cover.jpg** is forbidden. Hard drive space is cheap. *seiri* will not care about your cover.jpg.

*seiri* works with most music formats, as long as you follow the rules above.

## Adding music
There is only one way to add music to your library with *seiri*. Next to your library folder, *seiri* will create an *Automatically add to Library* folder. Once you have finished tagging your music, place it into this folder. *seiri* will then move the songs to the proper place in your library folder, and index it in its database. 

You can delete or re-tag files in your library folder, but do not move it to another folder, or *seiri* will not be able to keep track of it. If you make a tag change, you can ask *seiri* to refresh it, and the music will be reorganized.

You can make top-level subfolders under the *Automatically add to Library* folder to keep track of the source. For example, if you had a *YouTube*\* folder, and an *iTunes*\* folder, *seiri* will automatically mark whether you retrieved the track from iTunes, or YouTube, and make these tags queryable.

<sub>*I hope you're not getting your music by ripping from YouTube ðŸ˜‰.</sub> 

## Help, I'm getting *Error* when I try to add tracks!
Your track file is likely corrupt. *seiri* does some preliminary verification of tracks to catch corrupt files. If your file is lossless, you can try re-encoding your file. You must otherwise verify that the track is properly encoded.

Ensure your tracks have the correct tag otherwise missing tag errors can occur.
## Queries
*seiri* supports querying your library using *bangs*. All bang inputs are case insensitive.

|Bang|Description|Inputs|
|----|-----------|------|
||Track Title Search|The empty bang matches all tracks in the database. In addition, a bang-less search matches track titles partially.|
|`!!`|The group bang|Another bang expression.|
|`!q`|Full Text Search|Matches track title, album title, artist partially.|
|`!Q`|Exact Full Text Search|Matches track title, album title, artist exactly.|
|`!al`|Album Title|Matches the name of the album partially.|
|`!AL`|Exact Album Title|Matches the name of the album exactly.|
|`!ala`|Album Artists|Matches the name of the album artist partially.|
|`!ALA`|Exact Album Artists|Matches the name of the album artist exactly.|
|`!f`|Format|`flac, mp3, alac, aac, vorbis, opus, wavpack` are self explanatory. The special tags `flac16, flac24` allow for distinction between FLAC bitrates, and `cbr, vbr` allow for distinction between constant bitrate MP3 and variable bitrate MP3.|
|`!br[lt\|gt]`|Bitrate strictly \[Less Than \| Greater Than\]|Integer|
|`!c(w\|h)[lt\|gt]`|Cover art has (width\|height) strictly \[Less Than \| Greater Than\]|Integer|
|`!c`|Has cover art in tags|`true` or `false`|
|`!mb`|Has [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) IDs in tags|`true` or `false`|
|`!dup`|Is a duplicate of another track (iTunes-like algorithm)|`true` or `false`|


Bangs can be combined with the logical symbols `&` (AND) and `|` (OR). The group bang `!!` is used to group multiple bangs together for scoping. There is also *true tick* syntax, where for bangs that take boolean values, can be written ``!dup` `` as shorthand for `!dup{true}`. If for some reason a closing brace `}` or backslash '\' occurs in your search, bangs support escape characters `\}` and `\\`.

Bangs are parsed and transpiled into SQLite statements, which are then executed on the library database for fast results.


## Building

*seiri* consists of multiple components.
 - *seiri-lib* is the main component written in Rust that handles database connections, monitoring of the library folder, and parsing and transpilation of query bangs. This library is automatically built as part of *seiri-watcher* and *seiri-client*.
 
 - *libkatatsuki* is an abstraction over [taglib2](https://github.com/taglib/taglib/tree/taglib2) used to read tags from music files. 
 *libkatatsuki* and its Rust bindings *katatsuki-rs* are automatically built when building *seiri-watcher* and *seiri-client*.
 
 - *seiri-client* is an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) application that handles interfacing with *seiri-client*, and acts as a watchdog in case *seiri-client* crashes, as well an automatic updater. We try to be mindful of memory usage, and usually start the Chrome render process only when necessary. You will need to build this with `yarn build`.
 
 - *seiri-watcher* handles watching and adding new tracks. This should be built as part of *seiri-client*.
 
 - *seiri-neon* is the recommended way to interface with the core. It uses node's native extension support to call into Rust natively and interface with the Tracks database. This is built automatically with *seiri-client*.
 
 - *seiri-client-internals* is the actual user interface for *seiri-client*, consisting mostly of React code. This should be built as part of *seiri-client*.
 
 
 Read *build.md* for more information about setting up the environment.
